# ROS MCP Server Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating how to use the ROS MCP Server with different robotic systems and simulators.

## Available Examples

### üê¢ [Turtlesim Example](turtlesim/)

**Difficulty**: Beginner  
**Description**: A simple example using ROS2 Turtlesim - the classic "Hello World" of ROS robotics.

**What you'll learn**:
- How to set up a Docker container with ROS2 and Turtlesim
- How to automatically launch Turtlesim with ROS Bridge WebSocket server
- How to connect the MCP server to control a simulated robot
- Basic ROS2 topic and service interaction

**Prerequisites**: Docker and Docker Compose

**Quick Start**:
```bash
cd examples/turtlesim
docker compose up -d
```

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Automatic Docker setup with ROS2 Humble
- ‚úÖ Turtlesim with visual interface
- ‚úÖ ROS Bridge WebSocket server (ws://localhost:9090)
- ‚úÖ Turtle teleop for manual control
- ‚úÖ MCP server integration ready

### üê¢ [TurtleBot3 Example](turtlebot/)

**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Description**: Control a TurtleBot3 robot in the Gazebo simulator through the ROS MCP Server.  

**What You'll Learn**
- Launching Gazebo with a robot and `ros2_control`
- Publishing velocity commands with `/cmd_vel`
- Reading odometry from `/odom`
- Exposing ROS topics/services via ROS Bridge WebSocket
- Connecting MCP to a more realistic robot than Turtlesim

**Prerequisites**: Docker and Docker Compose

**Quick Start**:
```bash
cd examples/turtlebot3
docker compose up -d
```

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Automatic Docker setup with ROS2 Humble + Gazebo
- ‚úÖ TurtleBot3 model (burger by default, can set waffle/waffle_pi)
- ‚úÖ ROS Bridge WebSocket server on port 9090
- ‚úÖ Keyboard teleop for manual driving
- ‚úÖ MCP integration ready for natural language commands
